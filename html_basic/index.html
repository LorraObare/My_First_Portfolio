    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my first portfolio</p>
    <p>I have doing my front end program with Alx Africa and so far I really love the process.</p>
     
    <h2>Why do I do it?</h2>
    <p>One thing for sure, Alx has taught me the importance of sacrifice, doing this program has made me to get up early in the morning so that I can set the right time to do my modules.</p>
    <p>Also, I have learnt that consistency is the key to success, I have to be consistent in doing my modules and also in learning new things.</p>
    <p>It was so hard to find the balance at the start but I genuinely love what I do and that is why I am still here.</p>
    <p>Finally, I do it because I want to be a better version of myself and I know that this is the right path to get there.</p>

    <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
    <p>My goals are to be a full stack developer, I want to be able to create beautiful and functional websites and applications.</p>
    <p>I also want to be able to work with a team of developers and learn from  them.</p>
    <p>One goal that is rooted deeply in my heart is to teach street children tech. Tech has really empowered me and made me so confident and happy, I cant imagine what that would do to someone with the same passion given the same opportunity.</p>

    <h3>To Alx, <em>I am truly grateful</em></h3>
